12. First and Last
Design a Python program that asks the user for a series of names (in no particular order). After the final personâ€™s name
has been entered, the program should display the name that is first alphabetically and the name that is last
alphabetically. For example, if the user enters the names Kristin, Joel, Adam, Beth, Zeb, and Chris, the program will
display Adam and Zeb.
