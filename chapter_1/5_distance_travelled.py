5. Distance Traveled
Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be calculated with the
following formula:

Distance = Speed Ã— Time

A car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. Design a Python program that displays the following:
- The distance the car will travel in 5 hours
- The distance the car will travel in 8 hours
- The distance the car will travel in 12 hours
"""

speed = 60

print("The distance the car will travel in 5 hours:", speed * 5)
print("The distance the car will travel in 8 hours:", speed * 8)
print("The distance the car will travel in 12 hours:", speed * 12)
