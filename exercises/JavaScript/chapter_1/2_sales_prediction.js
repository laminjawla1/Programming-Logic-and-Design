// 2. Sales Prediction
// A company has determined that its annual profit
// is typically 23 percent of total sales.
// Design a Python program that asks the user to enter
// the projected amount of total sales,
// and then displays the profit that will be made from that amount.
// Hint: Use the value 0.23 to represent 23 percent.

const totalSales = 1000
const profit = 0.23 * totalSales;
console.log("Profit:", profit);
