// 8. Area of a Trapezoid
// Design a Python program that will ask the user to enter the two bases of a trapezoid and height. The program should
// computer the area and display the result. (Hint: area of the trapezoid is 1‚ÅÑ2 *(base1 + base2)*height)

const base_1 = 8
const base_2 = 7
const height = 4

const area = 0.5 * (base_1 + base_2) * height

console.log("Area of a trapezoid:", area)
